After\r\n          getting her BS in theoretical mathematics from the University of\r\n          Washington in 1962, she got her PhD in Radiation Biology and\r\n          Biophysics from the University of Rochester, NY in 1968. Her thesis\r\n          explored &quot;The Transition from Host to Phage metabolism after the\r\n          Infection of E. coli by Bacteriophage T4&quot;. She focused\r\n          particularly on the role of T4&#39;s substitution of 5 HMdC for C in\r\n          T4 DNA on the complete inhibition of host transcription and the\r\n          gradual breakdown of host DNA. After 3 years in the lab of Rolf\r\n          Benzinger at the University of Virginia, she came to teach at the\r\n          Evergreen State College in 1972, bringing with her an NIH grant. Her\r\n          Evergreen lab has continued to explore phage-host interactions ever\r\n          since, and has put on biennial phage meetings since 1975; their 2017\r\n          meeting drew 250 scientists young and old from 41 countries. From\r\n          1975-79, she was on the NIH director&#39;s original Recombinant DNA\r\n          Advisory Committee, selected as coming from a college where\r\n          &quot;teaching the ethics and values of science are part of the\r\n          teaching of science&quot;. After a sabbatical in 1978-79 with Bruce\r\n          Alberts at UCSF, she led the international work from 1979-1994 that\r\n          completed sequencing of the T4 genome. This included spending 4 months\r\n          in the Soviet Union through an Academy of Sciences exchange in 1990,\r\n          which also led to her discovery of their therapeutic applications of\r\n          bacteriophages and to still-ongoing collaborations with the Eliava\r\n          Institute in Tbilisi. In 1997, she started a Phagebiotics Foundation\r\n          to help support research there and to stimulate phage therapy\r\n          knowledge and research internationally. Though formally retired in\r\n          2010, she maintains a student-centered basic phage research lab at\r\n          Evergreen as well as a strong role in phage collaborations and\r\n          meetings around the world, and has led the Phagebiotics work with\r\n          diabetic ulcers and with exploring and supporting research on other\r\n          medical applications.{' '}\r\n        </MDBCol>\r\n      </MDBRow>\r\n      <MDBRow className='sab-card my-4 px-3 py-3 '>\r\n        <MDBCol md='3'>\r\n          <img src={pic} className='img-fluid py-3 sab-pic' alt='' />\r\n          <h4 className='text-center'>Randolph Fish, DPM</h4>\r\n          <h5 className='text-center'>(Board member)</h5>\r\n        </MDBCol>\r\n        <MDBCol className='py-3' md='9'>\r\n          Randolph is a board-certified podiatrist (ABPM) with more than 30\r\n          years of experience in clinical wound management.

The art was first developed at the Pasteur Institute\r\n          in Paris in 1917, practiced to some extent in France until the 1980s,\r\n          and is still fairly extensively used and further developed in such\r\n          places as Russia and the Republic of Georgia.1 After the advent of\r\n          chemical antibiot-ics in the 1940s, it was largely forgotten in the\r\n          Western world. Today, however, the increased prevalence of bacteria\r\n          that are resistant to most or all available antibiotics is\r\n          precipitating a major health crisis, as is passionately stressed by\r\n          the World Health Organization and by gov-ernments, scientists, and\r\n          health practitioners worldwide.2 In particular, extensive research\r\n          work has been published by the Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and\r\n          Experimental Therapy in Wroclaw, Poland’s center of phage therapy,\r\n          complementing the ongoing routine use of phage in the Republic of\r\n          Georgia.3 Numerous patients from around the world have been treated in\r\n          recent years in Phage International’s Phage Therapy Center and in the\r\n          Eliava Phage Therapy Center in Tbilisi, Georgia, long the epicenter of\r\n          therapeutic phage production and application, as further discussed\r\n          later in the following section.Today, the one major western European\r\n          center carrying out phage therapy is at the LabMCT, which is part of\r\n          the burn wound center of the Queen Astrid Military Hospital in\r\n          Brussels, Belgium. The LabMCT provides phage active ingredients to\r\n          pharmacists who produce preparations for patients in Belgium under the\r\n          magistral framework (Pirnay et al., 2018).4 This framework, roughly\r\n          analogous to the compounding framework in the United States or the\r\n          Specials framework in the UK, allows the Belgian phage ecosystem to\r\n          fill prescriptions with phage preparations that are tailor-made to\r\n          each patient. In Belgium, as at the Hirszfeld Institute, phage\r\n          cocktails are prepared from phages that have been determined to be\r\n          active against a patient’s clinical isolate through the use of a\r\n          companion diagnostic method. In the United States, the Food and Drug\r\n          Administration (FDA) now also quite routinely approves compassionate\r\n          use of phage therapy in individual very serious cases where there are\r\n          no other options. One such case, involving a near-fatal Acinetobacter\r\n          infection of a UC San Diego faculty member and a massive worldwide\r\n          effort that found the phages that rescued him after 4 months in a\r\n          coma, is described in some detail later in this chapter. The\r\n          spectacular success there led the UC San Diego clinic to apply phage\r\n          therapy in half a dozen cases where organ transplants were being\r\n          blocked by intransigent infections. The UC San Diego has just made a\r\n          million-dollar investment in developing a phage therapy center and\r\n          relevant sources of potential therapeutic phages are springing up.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </MDBContainer>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Bio;\r\n","C:\\Users\\casey\\Desktop\\Projects\\non-profit-site\\src\\utils\\membersObjects.js",[],"C:\\Users\\casey\\Desktop\\Projects\\non-profit-site\\src\\components\\Card\\Card.js",["81"],"import React from 'react';\r\nimport { MDBRow, MDBCol, MDBBox } from 'mdbreact';\r\n\r\nimport './styles.css';\r\n\r\nconst Card = (props) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <MDBRow className='bod-card my-4 px-3 py-3 '>\r\n      <MDBCol md='3'>\r\n        <img src={props.image} className='img-fluid py-3 bod-pic' alt='' />\r\n        <h4 className='text-center'>{props.name}</h4>\r\n        <h5 className='text-center'>({props.title})</h5>\r\n      </MDBCol>\r\n      <MDBCol className='py-3' md='9'>\r\n        {props.bio}\r\n      </MDBCol>\r\n    </MDBRow>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Card;\r\n",{"ruleId":"82","replacedBy":"83"},{"ruleId":"84","replacedBy":"85"},{"ruleId":"82","replacedBy":"86"},{"ruleId":"84","replacedBy":"87"},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"89","line":6,"column":3,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":6,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"92","severity":1,"message":"93","line":25,"column":17,"nodeType":"94","endLine":29,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"92","severity":1,"message":"93","line":30,"column":17,"nodeType":"94","endLine":34,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"95","line":2,"column":10,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":16},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"96","line":2,"column":32,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":38},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"97","line":3,"column":3,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":3,"endColumn":15},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"98","line":15,"column":3,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":15,"endColumn":10},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"99","line":2,"column":40,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":46},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"96","line":2,"column":24,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":30},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"95","line":2,"column":32,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":38},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"99","line":2,"column":40,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":46},{"ruleId":"92","severity":1,"message":"93","line":14,"column":9,"nodeType":"94","endLine":17,"endColumn":11},{"ruleId":"88","severity":1,"message":"99","line":2,"column":26,"nodeType":"90","messageId":"91","endLine":2,"endColumn":32},"no-native-reassign",["100"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["101"],["100"],["101"],"no-unused-vars","'MDBCardImage' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","'MDBCol' is defined but never used.","'MDBRow' is defined but never used.","'MDBContainer' is defined but never used.","'MDBIcon' is defined but never used.","'MDBBox' is defined but never used.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
