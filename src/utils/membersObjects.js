    bio:
      ' Elizabeth Kutter has worked with bacteriophages since 1963. After getting her BS in theoretical mathematics from the University of Washington in 1962, she got her PhD in Radiation Biology and Biophysics from the University of Rochester, NY. Her thesis explored "The Transition from Host to Phage metabolism after the Infection of E. coli by Bacteriophage T4." She focused particularly on the role of T4\'s substitution of 5 HMdC for C in T4 DNA on the complete inhibition of host transcription and the gradual breakdown of host DNA. After 3 years in the lab of Rolf Benzinger at the University of Virginia, she came to teach at the Evergreen State College in 1972, bringing with her an NIH grant. Her Evergreen lab has continued to explore phage-host interactions ever since, and has put on biennial phage meetings since 1975. From 1975-79, she was on the NIH director\'s original Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, selected as coming from a college where "teaching the ethics and values of science are part of the teaching of science".

    bio:
      'Gregg is a private practice veterinarian who became interested in phage therapy through an intern in his practice who was also a student in Dr. Kutter’s lab, investigating phage active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This led to his role as clinical investigator in a CRDF-sponsored project between the Evergreen phage lab and the Eliava Institute in Georgia studying the efficacy of phage preparations against Pseudomonas infections in canine ears. Gregg received his B.A. from the Evergreen State College in 1980 and his D.V.M. from Washington State University in 1984. He is the owner of Tumwater Veterinary Hospital and is also a founding member and consulting veterinarian to Evergreen’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.',

    bio:
      'Jan graduated from Evergreen in 1990 with a BS focused on microbiology. Early in life, she had been a serious student of music & piano, but was equally caught up with a curiosity for biology and process. From 1966 -1970 she pursued her piano/Music degree at Cal State Long Beach, minoring in Biology, and then worked as a professional accompanist. After several years and a move from California to Washington, Jan was drawn back to her science interests, returning to school at Evergreen in 1988. There, she signed up for the full-time Molecule to Organism program, where T4 phage particularly caught her interest. Jan worked in the T4 Lab for a year while also a student, graduated in 1990, and joined the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission Fish Health Lab as microbiologist. Jan retired in July 2013 but is now back working part time at Northwest Indian Fisheries to help through their busiest season. She has been on the Phagebiotics Foundation Board since its inception in 1997.',

She joined the board of the Phagebiotics Foundation in 2001, drawn to its work because she lived next door to Dr. Kutter, enjoyed long philosophical conversations about world health issues, became fascinated with phage, and traveled to Georgia to explore phage application there. Amy is currently the Technology Manager for Brand Licensing and Intellectual Property in DuPont’s Titanium Technologies business in Wilmington, Delaware, and brings her international experience with business agreements and intellectual property management along with her enthusiasm and critical eye to the Phagebiotics Foundation Board of Directors.',

    bio:
      ' Bob, an Evergreen phage lab graduate with a Master’s degree from Ohio State, has long been interested in the therapeutic applications of phages and has co-authored several articles on the subject with Dr. Kutter and other colleagues. He is now a doctoral student in the Laboratory of Gene Technology at KU Leuven in Belgium, studying the changing patterns of host and phage transcription during infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by each of the 6 quite different lytic Pseudomonas phage genera suitable for therapeutic applications, using the powerful new RNA-Seq method of analysis. Bob is very interested in the power of molecular genetics and the details of phage infection, viral ecology and evolution, the mysterious intersections between biofilm ecology and defense against phage in Pseudomonas, and the systems some phage use to eliminate their hosts’ gene expression while protecting their own. He also is our liaison with the European therapeutic phage community and participates actively in Board meetings on Skype',
